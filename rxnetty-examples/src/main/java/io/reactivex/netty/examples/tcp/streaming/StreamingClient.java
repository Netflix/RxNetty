/**
 * A TCP streaming example.
 *
 * This example assumes that the server to which this client connects (using the below mentioned option), sends an
 * infinite stream of new line seperated strings. This client only takes 10 items from that infinite stream and then
 * terminates the connection.
 *
 * There are three ways of running this example:
 *
 * <h2>Default</h2>
 *
 * The default way is to just run this class with no arguments, which will start a server ({@link StreamingServer}) on
 * an ephemeral port and then send an HTTP request to that server and print the response.
 *
 * <h2>After starting {@link StreamingServer}</h2>
 *
 * If you want to see how {@link StreamingServer} work, you can run {@link StreamingServer} by yourself and then pass
 * the port on which the server started to this class as a program argument:
 *
 <PRE>
 java io.reactivex.netty.examples.tcp.streaming.StreamingClient [server port]
 </PRE>
 *
 * <h2>Existing TCP server</h2>
 *
 * You can also use this client to connect to an existing TCP server (different than {@link StreamingServer}) by
 * passing the port and host of the existing server similar to the case above:
 *
 <PRE>
 java io.reactivex.netty.examples.tcp.streaming.StreamingClient [server port] [server host]
 </PRE>
 * If the server host is omitted from the above, it defaults to "127.0.0.1"
 *
 * In all the above usages, this client will print the response received from the server.
 *
 * @see StreamingServer Default server for this client.
